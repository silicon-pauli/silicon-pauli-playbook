# Crazy Eights

## Abstract

Crazy Eights is a rapid visual brainstorming technique, that helps creating many solutions in very short time.
Based on an initial problem definition, each participant has eight minutes to sketch possible solutions in eight boxes on a sheet of paper.
In a team of 9 persons you get a total of 72 possible solutions in 8 minutes. Awesome.

Afterwards the findings are presented by each participant to the team.

| Prerequisites |
| :--- | :--- |
| People | Workshop team |
| Time | 5 - 10 minutes for problem definition, <br />8 minutes for sketching, <br />4 minutes for presenting each Crazy Eight |
| Materials | Paper (A4), <br />Big Sticky Notes, <br />Felttip Pens |

## When to run

You can run this whenever you have a clear understanding what your interface is supposed to do. 
It is commonly used after the phaes of Discovery and Define. 
In a Design Sprint this technique is elemental after the definition of How Might Wes.

## Why to run

The method creates a lot of ideas in very short time. 
This allows to explore many potential design routes quickly.

It also helps to bring the team in a creative mood where everything – even whacky ideas – are allowed.

The fact that the participants are brainstorming and sketching on their own avoids group think, gives introverts an equal voice and allows for individual ideas.

## How to run

1. Have each participant fold a A4-sized or letter-sized sheet of paper into eight rectangles (by folding it three times).
2. For 60 seconds at a time, each partcipant will sketch one of their ideas in one of the rectangles. 
The idea is for each person to tackle an idea or component of the product – whatever comes to mind first. 
This can be a specific piece of copy, a functionality, an interaction, etc – but you only get 60 seconds per rectangle. 
Tell everyone that it's ok if it's ugly.
3. After 60 seconds, the participants move on to the next rectangle, where they can iterate on their previous thought process, or move on to a new component. 
Enforce the time constraint and keep moving.
4. At the end of this process, the participants take turns in explaining their eight ideas. 
It's ok to have brief discussions at this point, in order to fully absorb all these new ideas, but keep it brief.
Also make sure that ideas are not rated by any participants at this point.
