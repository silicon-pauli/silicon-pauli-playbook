# Solution Sketch

## Abstract

The Solution Sketch is a method used to expand upon one solution idea. 
In this exercise, each team member spends more time articulating one idea they are most interested in, regardless of the most popular ideas found before. 
It is okay to sketch a new idea or a combination of ideas, and a sketch can even include other peopleâ€™s ideas.

The goal is to create one fully fleshed out idea for the solution that is thought to be the best. 
Each team member creates their own detailed Solution Sketch. 
A Solution Sketch should include three frames or states of the concept to help illustrate how it works, as well as a clear title to help people remember it.

The catch is: The people won't be able to present their own ideas. 
All sketches are hung on a wall and presented by the facilitator. 
This removes the persuasive abilities of charismatic people and levels the playground.

## When to run

Solution Sketch is most helpful when a lot of potential solutions are on the table. 
It is commonly used after the brainstorming session of Crazy Eights in a Design Sprint.

## Why to run

Solution sketches allow the participants to create a user journey like storyboard from all artifacts that were created before. 
The out come often is a remix of everything the participants came up with themselves and the ideas of everyone else in the room.
This is also a lesson in collaboration.

Afterwards the voted results from a Solution Sketch can be used to build prototypes, test and validate them. 
This way it can strongly inform the following UI design and development processes.

## How to run

1. Select the idea or a combination of ideas from your own or others you think is the best
2. Create a three panel storyboard by sketching in three sticky notes on a sheet of paper.
3. Make it self-explanatory.
4. Keep it anonymous.
5. Ugly is okay.
6. Words matter.
7. Give it a catchy title.
8. All sketches a put on a wall or whiteboard. The facilitator explains the solutions.
