# User Journey Mapping

## Abstract
User Journey Mapping is a method that maps out a user’s experience step by step as they encounter the product. 

It is a timeline of user actions that describes the relationship between the brand/product. 
It should document all touchpoints between a customer and our organization, including all channels they happen in.

Journey maps are often for a specific type of user, also known as a persona. 
If there many users or players involved in the product, multiple journey maps may be required, one for each user type.

## Details

A really simple user journey map for a weather app could look something like this:

## Details

A Customer Journey Map can be built from several starting points. 

Very often people use **Personas** as a starting point if the are already present. 
The idea of Personas is to create a prototypical specificiation of a person that from then on represents a whole user group.
Personas should always be created based on findings from research and interviews and should be validated again after the creation.

**Empathy Maps** can also be used as a good starting point. 
Empathy Maps help to better understand the user's motivations for decision making.
[TBD] 

Another way is to start from **Jobs To Be Done** that were discovered through customer interviews. 
Jobs To Be Done helps to fond ut about the higher purpose for which customers hire products, services, and solutions.
This gives us a stronger focus on the needs and demands the user has when using our product.
The context and push and pull factors around the Jobs To Be Done that were likely discovered can help as context for the User Journey Maps as well.

<!-- 
Ideally we should be able to answer the following questions:

* **Context:** What is going on in your user’s day when they engage with your product? 
Are they in a rush? 
Worried? 
Planning an adventure?
* **Motivation:** What drives your user to interact with your product? 
What are they hoping to get out of it? 
Why are they using your product instead of a competitor’s—or nothing at all?
* **Mental Models:** How does your user conceive of the problem space that your product addresses? 
What concepts and connections come naturally to them, and what do they need to be taught?
* **Pain Points:** What are the challenges users are facing? 
Is your product helping them solve these or aggravating them? 
Are there any obstacles they have to using your product?

Coming back to the Weather App the answers from your interviews could look like this:

A Commuter:

* **Context:** It looks like it might rain any second now.
* **Motivation:** I don’t want to get drenched on my way to a work.
* **Pain Points:** I need reliable information about the weather by the hour.
* **Mental Models:** I have timeslots where I expect to be biking to and from work. 
I want to make sure that if it rains with any of those timeslots, I know to walk instead so I can bring my umbrella. 
But if it’s rain AND high winds, that will tear apart my umbrella, so I’ll take the bus or a taxi.

A Picnic Host:

* **Context:** I’m making weekend plans and want to have a picnic.
* **Motivation:** I want to know which day this weekend has the best weather for outdoor activities.
* **Pain Points:** I want to know with certainty what the weather is going to be a few days in advance so I can plan accordingly.
* **Mental Models:** Picnics are best when the weather is between 70 and 80 degrees and sunny—but temperature is more important than sun; 
I’ll try to find a day with both, but prioritize temperature if both aren’t available.

A hobbyist gardener:

* **Context:** Did it rain this week? I can't remember.
* **Motivation:** I don’t overwater my plants.
* **Pain Points:** How can i find if it rained this week? Is this even possible?
* **Mental Models:** Usually I just care about the last 3 days, but a really major rainstorm would soak the ground for a week. 
I need to know exactly when it rained and how much.

## When to run

We can build a Customer Journey Map when we have gathered enough insights from research and user interviews. 

This can either happen by working directly with the raw data from the interviews or after compiling the data into Personas or Jobs To Be Done. 

## Why to run

User Journey Maps helps us to gain insight into how users experience the product, based on their unique motivations and goals.
These insights can show opportunities for improvements and innovations of the prodct.

Customer Journey Maps help the product team to to think about the user's needs effectively and avoids working based on assumptions.

For example, a finding might be that it's better to remove a step from the onboarding flow, 
change the copy in a lead nurturing email, 
or add tooltips to help users learn something—all based on the actions the users take. 
This leads to a more customer-centric approach to product building, which ultimately leads to better customer relationships.

Mapping out the users' experiences also allows us to understand several important factors that shape the overall impression they will walk away with. 

Some questions to ask about the users' journey could include:

* Why did they discover the product in the first place?
* How easy is the product to understand and use immediately?
* How long it does it take them to accomplish what they came there to do?
* How easy did they perceive this to be?
* How well does their experience extend across multiple channels, and where do they experience gaps?

The answers to these questions can help us to better understand what motivates the users and what they're most likely to find helpful. 

The artifacts created with customer Journey Mapping can inform several other methods, 
like Storyboarding or brainstorming techniques like Crazy Eights, 
but can also be used for writing marketing copy or planning campaigns.

## How to run

1. Write sticky notes: Mine research and customer interviews for actions, questions, delight, pain points, push or pull forces etc. the users experienced while pursuing their motivations.
2. Map them to the Customer Journey Map Template
3. Discover oportunities to ease pain points
4. Compile the finding in a digital representation after the meeting

###### 1. Write sticky notes

Try to be concise and close to the user. If possible try to write down the exact words mentioned in the interviews.

###### 2. Map them to the Customer Journey Map Template

Here's the template:

<figure>
    <img style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} src="/public/images/USER_JOURNEY_MAP_TEMPLATE.svg" alt="User Journey Map Template" />
    {/* <figcaption style={{ opacity: 0.5 }}><small><i>Fig. 2 – User Jounrey Map Template</i></small></figcaption> */}
</figure>

###### 3. Discover oportunities to ease pain points

The focus should be on creating a smooth and intuitive user journey, no matter what type of onboarding UX or product experience we build.

What seems intuitive to us as designers or marketers isn't necessarily intuitive to users. 
We work with the product every day and have a vested interest; users just need to accomplish one thing, and they don't have a reason to care beyond that.

By doing a little research and identifying what that one thing is — and helping the users get there quickly — we canensure that the product is valuable. 
And by making it easy for users to accomplish their goals the first time around, we'll ensure that they keep coming back again and again.

It's also good to keep in mind that if users face roadblocks with our product, they are likely to look out for alternatives.

###### 4. Compile the finding in a digital representation

After the workshop take a few photos of the Customer Journey Map and compile it into a more readable digital version.

The Happy Moments and Pain Points could be used as a positive and negative dimensions on the y-axis, while the steps are visualized on the x-axis. 
Make sure to explain the Steps in detail and to also include the touchpoint (left out in the example).

    <img style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} src="/public/images/USER_JOURNEY_MAP_DIGITAL.svg" alt="User Journey Map (digitalized)" />
    {/* <figcaption style={{ opacity: 0.5 }}><small><i>Fig. 3 – User Jounrey Map (digitalized)</i></small></figcaption> */}
