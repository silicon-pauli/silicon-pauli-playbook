# The Five Whys

## Abstract
The Five Whys is an iterative questioning technique to explore the root of a problem by asking why events occured or conditions existed.
Most commonly, it's used early in the research process, as it can provide insights into underlying issues. Compared to other methods from the Discovery Phase, 5 Whys is a fast executable method that gives very fast results. 

Sakichi Toyoda developed this technique in the 1930s. The method became widely popular in the 1970s, and Toyota is still using it today to solve problems.

## When to run

Should be run whenever there is a problem. 
This can be a technical problem, a problem in the service, you name it.

## Why to run

##### Information sharing:  
When done within teams, it allows all team members to learn about the root cause of problems and how to tackle such situations in the future. It is a useful tool to build problem-solving competencies within team members as well.

##### The bottom of things:  
The methods support digging deep into the problem and shedding its layers of complexities to arrive at a logical solution to the issue in question.

##### Easy to implement:
So easy to implement that can be practiced with great sophistication to yield meaningful insights

##### It creates counter-measures
A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring.

## How to run

##### Before you start
Observe the problem and note the first question. Further questions should build up sensibly and according on previous answers.

##### Steps

1. Observe a problem and create a problem statement.
2. Utilizing the problem statement, ask ‘Why’ or ‘Why is that?’ (Why #1)
3. Answer the question above, and again ask, “Why is the answer occurring?”
4. Repeat for Whys #3, #4 and #5, as well as any more that are needed.
5. Repeat the whole process as many times as necessary to determine potential root causes.
6. Document: Document the presented answers. This can be done by the interviewer or a colleague. 
7. Identify patterns that emerge from the informations you gathered. This can lead to the root of the problem.
  
##### Definition of done
When it doesn't make sense to ask any further questions, you probably found the reason for the problem. 

##### Pitfalls
Can the problem statement be answered by your final answer? If not, ask further questions. 

## Example

#### Observe a problem:
> "The customer is unhappy with the product, because it is not one they ordered."

#### Create a problem statement:
> "A wrong item was shipped to the customer."

#### Investigate on the problem statement:
> **Why #1:** "Why was a wrong item shipped to the customer?"<br />
> **Answer #1:** "The wrong item was pulled from inventory."<br /><br />

> **Why #2:** "Why was a wrong item pulled from inventory?"<br />
> **Answer #2:** "The item we pulled from inventory was mislabeled."<br /><br />

> **Why #3:** "Why was the item mislabeled?"<br />
> **Answer #3:** "Our supplier mislabeled the item before shipping it to our warehouse."<br /><br />

> **Why #4:** "Why did our supplier mislabel the item?"<br />
> **Answer #4:** "The person applying labels to our product at the supplier placed the wrong label on the product."<br /><br />

> **Why #5:** "Why did the person place the wrong label on the product?"<br />
> **Answer #5:** "Labels for different orders are pre-printed, so it's easy to apply the wrong label."
  
##### Possible Solution:
> Mistake-proof the label printing and application process.

If, on the other hand, you had not asked any further questions but provided a solution after each answer, it wouldn't probably solve the problem:

> **Why #1:** "Why was a wrong item shipped to the customer?"<br />
> **Answer #1:** "The wrong item was pulled from inventory."<br />
> **Solution:** "Retrain our stock pickers." Almost no benefit - this solution has nothing to do with the true case.<br /><br />

> **Why #2:** "Why was a wrong item pulled from inventory?"<br />
> **Answer #2:** "The item we pulled from inventory was mislabeled."<br />
> **Solution:** "Inspect our inventory" Minimal benefit - applies to current stock only.<br /><br />

> **Why #3:** "Why was the item mislabeled?"<br />
> **Answer #3:** "Our supplier mislabeled the item before shipping it to our warehouse."<br />
> **Solution:** "Have the supplier sort their stock to contain the problem." Very limited long-term benefit.<br /><br />

> **Why #4:** "Why did our supplier mislabel the item?"<br />
> **Answer #4:** "The person applying labels to our product at the supplier placed the wrong label on the product."<br />
> **Solution:** "Conduct training at the suppier" Limited long-term benefit.<br /><br />

> **Why #5:** "Why did the person place the wrong label on the product?"<br />
> **Answer #5:** "Labels for different orders are pre-printed, so it's easy to apply the wrong label."<br />
> **Solution:** "Mistake-proof the label printing and application process." Highly effective.
