# Jobs To Be Done

## Abstract
Jobs To Be Done is **not** a method to build products, services and solutions. 
It's a theory about the higher purpose for which customers hire products, services, and solutions.
It’s something we learn from our customers.

> In the factory we make cosmetics; in the drugstore we sell hope. – Charles Revson, founder of Revlon

## Details

It is very important to distiguish Jobs To Be Done from tasks or activities. For example:

`Listen to music.`  
`Cut a piece of wood in a straight line.`  
`Grill food.`  
`Get from point A to B on time.`  

are not Jobs. These are activities or tasks. They are about doing things, not becoming 'a better me'.

A Job To Be Done is about a desire for progress:

`#1 There is your current way of living/working`  
`#2 There is this new, better way of living/working you desire`  
`Constraints and obstacles block you going from #1 to #2`  

That is the Job to be Done.

Jobs To Be Done is about 'making progress'. It means that a person is making change in a positive direction. 
Making progress means that person is overcoming constraints, and is moving from the old way to a new and better way.

If we just look at **how** people use a product, we will not be able to understand **why** they use it.
For example: We see people using …

**… iPods** and think: Ah! They want to listen to music.  
**… Cars** and think: Ah! They want to get from point A to point B.  
**… Grills** and think: Ah! They want to grill food.  

We can just see the **how**, but not understand the underlying motivations.
If we instead look through the lens of 'progress', we can see **why** people buy and use products:

Some people buy iPods so other people will stop talking to them.  
Some people get cars because it represents independence.  
Some people grill because it is a ceremony of male bonding.  

On top of this, there are even a lot of products, that people don't even use.
Take insurances as an example. People don’t buy insurance to 'use' it, they buy it because they want to reduce financial risks.

## When to run

Analyzing Jobs To Be Done can be done at many moments in product development. 

It is very useful before starting to create a product as well as when starting new development cycle or to reassure the team if they are still on track in the current cycle.

## Why to run

It's important to understand that Jobs To Be Done only describes customers demand and motivations, but not what to about it.
It only helps understand the what-is, not the what-should-bes. But it can give valuable insights on how to proceed with the design process.

The biggest benefits of discovering Jobs To Be Done are

* Explain why consumers bought a product in the past (i.e. why markets look the way they do today)
* Predict what products consumers will buy in the future (i.e. what markets will look like in the future)

It can help us to:

* Figure out what information is or isn't important
* How to go about gathering the important information
* Find out what information can support the design, research, and strategy methods we can use in the future.

Different people can use JTBD to make progress in different ways:

**Innovators (designers)** can be more creative and have more focus, because they understand the positive change consumers want to make with a product.

**Managers** will have more control and have beneficial influence over those they support, because they can direct everyone towards the “true north” that the company and markets want.

**Marketers** know what language to use so they can get consumers’ attention and persuade them that your product is best.

**The organization**, on the whole, will work together better, because they share the same language and understanding of what business they are all in.

## How to run

There are three main steps to ensure a successful discovery of Jobs To Be Done:

1. Gathering data
2. Analysing data to extract Jobs to be Done and their context (covered in this play)
3. Run experiments to back up the findings
4. Use discovered Jobs to be Done define design, research, and strategy

### 1. Gathering data

Interviewing customers is one of the best ways to uncover Jobs to be Done as it allows us to go in-depth and uncover the 'why' of their actions. 
We want to find out why people use the products they do. While doing this, we also want to gather the contextual factors around this 'why'.

A very useful abstraction for this are the following questions:

* **Progress:** What progress is a person trying to make?
* **Actions:** What is someone doing to achieve this progress?
* **Pushes:** Factors that make someone look for a new solution
* **Pulls:** Factors that make someone adopt a new solution

To show an example:

* **Progress:** Getting to work on time
* **Actions:** Walking to the train station, buying a ticket, finding a seat
* **Pushes:** “I need to get to work on time to finish everything”, “The train is often delayed”, “It’s so crammed there are no seats available”, “I cannot work from home”
* **Pulls:** “I can do work while sitting in the train”, “It’s better for the environment than taking the car”, “My work is close to the station”, “I won’t have to pay any parking fees”

Asking for this will give us the necessary context to help formulate the actual Customer Jobs later.

###### Set up a JTBD interview

* **Use a semi-structured set-up.** 
Determine the areas we want to cover and formulate questions as a guideline, rather than a strict script to follow. 
By creating the freedom to deviate from our questions we can dive deeper into unexpected findings that might pop up. 
This way we can discover the unknown unknowns, the 'why' we otherwise would never have found out about.
* **Focus on past actions and experiences** rather than future predictions. 
People are bad at predicting their own behaviour for the future. 
Their past actions say a lot more about their future behaviour.
* Construct a timeline surrounding the ‘hiring’ of a service to get context. 
We can focus on the ‘big hire’: buying the product, or the ‘small hire’: using the product. 
When did you buy the product? 
Where? 
Was anyone else involved? 
What else happening at the moment? 
As an example check out the [interview on mattresses](http://jobstobedone.org/radio/the-mattress-interview-part-one/) on jobstobedone.org.

We think this is a good structure for an interview:

1. **Introduction:** 
Explain why the interview is taking place. 
Ask whether recording the interview is ok, let the interviewee sign non-disclosure agreement. 
Mention that there are no wrong or right answers.
2. **Introductory questions:** 
Ask the interviewee about where they live, their jobs, hobbies etc.
This helps us to familiarise ourself with their lives.
Later on in the interview we can refer to this and it also makes the interview more conversational.
3. **Main topics:** 
Start pushing the conversation in the direction of our product. 
Look out for statements that allow us to come up with follow-up questions. 
If the interview goes off path, hear the interviewee out, there might be something to discover. 
Then try to steer the conversation back to the topic.
Try to ask very personal questions later in the interview, when a bit of trust has built. 
Answers are more likely to be truthful and sibstantial then.
4. **End the interview:** 
Ask for any questions the interviewee has, or if there is anything to add. 
It is also a good idea to stop any recordings at this moment. 
This can make the interviewee feel more at ease and more likely to mention anything they otherwise wouldn't have.
Thank the interviewee for their time.

It's best to have one person completely focused on the interview. 
This also means that the interviewee will not be able to take notes. 
If possible, bring a note-taker and write down additional insights and non-verbal cues from memory after the interview.

With shorter and impromptu interviews a recording setup or a transcript is not feasible. 
Try to limit note-taking to writing down the signals we are looking for, preferably as quotes.

If there is time, we can write out the interview as a timeline or story for context.
Always try to note the Progress, Actions, Pushes and Pulls. 

If we plan to conduct longer interviews, we plan at least half an hour directly after the interview to summarise it. 
This helps us to note down non-verbal cues as everything is still fresh in mind.
If this is not possible, try to refrain from doing this purely from memory days after the interview. 
Rather watch or listen to any recordings taken and try to remember this way.

### 2. Analysing data to extract Jobs to be Done

After we gathered insights from Customer Interviews, it's time to extract the most miportant Jobs To Be Done.
We try to detect patterns in what interviewees said, and are looking for repeated mentions of the same signals.

A good way of doing this is cluster analysis, as it helps us with detecting patterns of similar reactions in qualitative data.

These steps help us conduct a very simple cluster analysis:

1. Write down the important findings and quotes from the interviews on sticky notes. Again focus on progress, actions, pushes, pulls.
2. Cluster the findings based on similarity. 
3. Ideally we will end up with a set of Action, Push and Pull statements.
4. Form Jobs To Be Done Statements:

<figure>
    <img style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} src="/public/images/JOBS_TO_BE_DONE_STATEMENT.svg" alt="Jobs To Be Done Statement" />
    {/* <figcaption style={{ opacity: 0.5 }}><small><i>Fig. 1 – Jobs To Be Done Statement</i></small></figcaption> */}
</figure>

We will now likely have dicovered multiple Jobs To Be Done. 
Now it's time to decide which ones offer the best opportunity for the product.

Keep in mind: We want to build a product that people will use. 
Most likely there is already something in place people do instead of using our solution.
That's why it is very important to understand the forces that make people look for and adopt a new solution. 
The forces diagram as illustrated by jobstobedone.org offers a great visualisation of this:

<figure>
    <img style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} src="/public/images/JOBS_TO_BE_DONE_FORCEFIELD.svg" alt="Jobs To Be Done Forcefield" />
    {/* <figcaption style={{ opacity: 0.5 }}><small><i>Fig. 1 – Jobs To Be Done Forcefield</i></small></figcaption> */}
</figure>

Here, **pushes** are what make people go out and look for a new solution and **pulls** are what convinces people to start using a certain solution. 
Consider this example: When looking for a new way to commute to work a **push** might be “It takes too long” and a **pull** might be “It is environment-friendly”.

But there are also forces working in the opposite direction:

Pushes have to be strong enough to overcome **allegiance to current behaviour**. 
It’s easy to stick to an old solution because it somehow 'does the job'. 
In this case it's unlikely that people look for or even consider a new solution. 

On top of that the **pull** of our product has be stronger than the **anxiety of new solutions**. 
People have to invest time and energy to use our solution. 
We need to have a convincing pitch that the benefits of our product are worth it.

Why is this so important? 
If we find a Job To Be Done and there are not enough pushes present it’s unlikely that people will start looking for a new solution. 
And ff they don't look for an alternative they will not find our product.

Then if people have to invest a lot of time and energy into our solution, we will have to make sure there a huge benefits in using our product. 
In Busines-To-Business settings this is often the case. 
Adoption of new solutions throughout a whole organization is much more time and energy-consuming than for an individual.

So what are **promising signs**?

* People are experiencing many pushes that drive them to look for a new solution.
* People are using a combination of solutions because no solution can get their Job Done in itself.
* People are using services not intended for that goal at all as it’s 'the best they can get'.
* People show how important it is when they talking about their Job to be Done very emotionally.

What are **not so promising** signs?

* People experience few pushes with current solutions.
* People have already invested a lot of time and energy in the current solution, and switching to another solution would be costly.
* People are not really interested in the topic. They probably don't care about finding a new solution.

###### Validate Customer Jobs

For beginners it's easy to make mistakes during interviews and analysis. 
In interviews we might miss a hunch and waste the chance for follow-up questions and interesting insights. 
In analysis we might come up with statements that might not be Jobs To Be Done.

The first is hard to prevent and can only be learnt by extensive prepration of the interviews and experience.  
The latter is easier to catch. We can apply the following validation to the dicovered Jobs To Done:

<figure>
    <img style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} src="/public/images/JOBS_TO_BE_DONE_VALIDATION.svg" alt="Validating Jobs To Be Done" />
    {/* <figcaption style={{ opacity: 0.5 }}><small><i>Fig. 1 – Validating Jobs To Be Done</i></small></figcaption> */}
</figure>


### 3. Run experiments to back up the findings

Once we finished discovering Jobs To Be Done, we can run experiments to make sure they really exist. 
This helps us answer the most important question: **Is the problem we found a problem worth solving?**

Running experiments helps us to:

* Find out if people are interested in our solution: Make a landing page advertising the solution, and measure how many people visit or sign up.
* Find out how many people are willing to pay for a solution: Ask them to sign up for a plan.

### 4. Use discovered Jobs to be Done

###### Choose a product strategy to pursue

After discovering and validating our Jobs To Be Done, we can pursue different strategies for our design process.

We can focus on **core job growth**: 
The idea is to make **better** solutions for the Jobs to be Done we have uncovered. 
We can do this this by focusing on resolving pains customers have with their current solutions.

We can also focus on **related job growth**: 
People are often trying to get done multiple things at the same time. 
For example reading the news to get informed ánd entertained. 
We can create value by enabling customers to get several Jobs Done at the same time.

We can focus on **disruptive job growth**: 
Sometimes existing products meet the demands of one group of people, but not for another one because of price, accessibility, etc. 
In this case we can focus on making the current solution available to these people as well.

###### Use Jobs to be Done to shape the Customer journey

Jobs to be Done research focuses on drawing out the timeline surrounding the ‘hiring’ of a service. 
With the big hire being the moment of buying, and the small hires being the moments of using the service. 
The timeline gives an image of all the factors that influence the choice for a certain service. 
Including the place someone goes to, the people that are involved, and the pains and gains a customer experiences.

This is a perfect outline for a customer journey. 
Use the Jobs to be Done to draw out storyboards chronicling the timeline surrounding the hiring of the service, including all the pains and gains the customer experiences. 
This storyboard can serve as inspiration for our Customer journey.

In case a customer journey is already in place, we can put it next to the timeline we discovered with Jobs To Be Done. 
Comparing the two can quickly give us insights for improvement.

###### Use Jobs to be Done to improve marketing

The context and timeline of Jobs to be Done also gives us clues where and how we can reach our customers. 
Ideally we know what websites people are they using when researching possible solutions. 
What search terms did they use? Where there pages they found especially trustworthy?
This can be a starting point to a media strategy to effectively target out customers.

After knowing where to reach the customers, we can also use our findings to define how to address them.
We now can focus our communications on the Job To Be Done instead of talking of the specifics of our product.
A good launch campaign always focuses on desirability over product characteristics.

Additional insights from the interviews, like tone of voice and wording, help us 'talk in the voice of the customer', making our messages more understandable and believable.
