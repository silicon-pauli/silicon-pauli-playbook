# Recruit a team

If you don't want to have a workshop all on your own, you will need a team.

Five to seven people work great. It's always good to have an odd number of people, so if it comes to democratic decision making, a majority can be found.

Get diverse skills along with the people who work on the project day-to-day. Also include people higher up in the chain of command. 
They then are part the team making the decisions and will have a better understanding later.
