# Set the rules

**No distractions:** No laptops, phones, or iPads allowed. If you need your device, leave the room or wait for a break.  

**Timebox:** A tight schedule builds confidence in the sprint process. Use a Time Timer to create focus and urgency.  

**Plan for a late lunch:** Take a snack break around 11:30 a.m. and lunch around 1 p.m. This schedule maintains energy and avoids lunch crowds.
