# Invite extra experts

Some people can provide very important insights to your workshop, but won't be able to participate throughout, especially if you run workshops over several days.

If you want to conduct interviews with experts, those should be invited ahead of time and for a time slot of at least 2 â€“ 3 hours. 
Check back a day before the workshop, if they can really make it.

Make sure to prepare some snacks and drinks for them and figure out a compensation for their efforts.
