# Book a room

Book a room with whiteboards (preferably two) for the entire length of the workshop. 

The room should be sufficiently big, with windows to let in some fresh air.

Consider adding a bit of a margin so you have time to set up supplies or hardware before and to allow for overrun towards the end of the workshop.
If you plan to do interviews, book a separate, possibly smaller room for those.

Double check that the room is really save for the time of your workshop. There should better be no surprises.
