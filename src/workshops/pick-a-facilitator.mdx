# Pick a facilitator

The facilitator will manage time, conversations, and the overall sprint process.

Look for someone who’s confident leading a meeting and synthesizing discussions on the fly while also being decisive regarding timeboxing.
A solid understanding of the methods that are to be used in the workshop is highly beneficial.

Sometimes larger organizations have dedicated Agile Masters that are experienced in this kind of exercise. 
Ask around… Otherwise it might be you!
