# Write a brief

The brief is a tool that helps you align your team and your stakeholders on the goleas and deliverables of your workshop. 

It's best if you use a shared document and use it to draft your workshop challenge and aganda. 

If possible you can already start thinking about the methods you plan to use in your workshop. 
This makes it easier to timebox the different activities of the day. 

You should also include an overview of the decision-makers, team, and all other participants.
