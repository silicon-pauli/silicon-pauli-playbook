# Workshop Supplies

We will likely need some or most of this. Be prepared.

✅ Lots of whiteboards. Wall-mounted are best, but rolling whiteboards are good, too. Alternatives: IdeaPaint, Post-it easel pads, or butcher paper taped to the walls. Get two big whiteboards (or equivalent surface area).

✅ Yellow 3-by-5 sticky notes. Stick with classic yellow, because the multicolored notes cause unnecessary cognitive load. Get fifteen pads.

✅ Black whiteboard markers. Using a thick marker will keep your ideas pithy and easy for others to read. We prefer whiteboard markers over Sharpies because they’re more versatile, they smell less, and you don’t have to worry about accidentally putting a permanent mark on your whiteboard. Get ten markers.

✅ Green and red whiteboard markers. For Friday’s observation notes. Get ten of each color.

✅ Black felt-tip pens. For sketching on Tuesday. Avoid super-thin pens that encourage microscopic writing. We like the medium-point Paper Mate Flair. Get ten pens.

✅ Printer paper. For sketching (sadly, not everything fits on a sticky note). Get one hundred sheets, letter-size or A4.

✅ Masking tape. For posting solution sketches on the walls. Get one roll.

✅ Small dot stickers (1⁄4-inch). For heat map votes. Must be all the same color (we like blue). If you’re searching online, these are often called “Round Color Coding Labels.” Get about two hundred small dots.

✅ Large dot stickers (3⁄4-inch). For How Might We votes, straw poll, and supervotes. Must be all the same color, and a different color than the small dots (we like pink or orange). Get about one hundred large dots.

✅ Time Timers. For keeping time throughout the sprint. Get two: one to keep the current activity on time, and one to remind you when to take a break.

✅ Healthy snacks. Good snacks will help keep your team’s energy up throughout the day. Eat real food like apples, bananas, yogurt, cheese, and nuts. For a boost, have dark chocolate, coffee, and tea. Get more than enough for everybody.
