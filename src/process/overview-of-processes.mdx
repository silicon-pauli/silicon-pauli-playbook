# Overview of processes

When we start building a product a lot of things are not known. 
We could simply build the product based on assumptions and common sense. But any errors we make would be apparent very late in the process. 
Or we could try to minimize the number of unknowns before we build anything by continuously validating our assumptions.

The processes outlined here help us do this.
