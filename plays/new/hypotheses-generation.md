#Hypotheses Generation

##Abstract
Hypotheses generation provides the **What** in product iterations: what to **build** and what to **measure**. Plus: a release roadmap by defining all hypotheses that have to be tested. 

##When to run
Hypothesis driven development is very effective in all situations where the team is uncertain about the problem and effective solutions. 

Generating hypotheses needs to occur when creating a product as well as when starting new development cycle or to reassure the team if they are still on track in the current cycle. 

1. Initial product creation
Generating hypotheses is the last thing you do before actually starting to design a new product. There are some things you should have done before starting: 
- initial vision statement (link)
- initial mission statement (link)
- initial/basic user/customer research (link)
- initial/basic competitive analysis (link)
- initial value proposition and/or elevator pitch (link)

What can really help but is not required:
- Product Field analysis (link) to have a frame of reference for your hypotheses
- Jobs-to-be-done analysis (link) to help you come up with assumptions

2. Starting a product development cycle
There are numerous ways to structure cycles, but they all try to give the product team focus: a theme, an OKR, a part of the product, whatever. Hypotheses generation is the first thing you want to do, after defining scope and timeframe of your cycle. The scope of these cycles does not have to be big to warrant hypotheses driven development. Requirements from 1. still apply but should have been done anyway. 

3. Anytime you are not sure what to do next
As soon as you are unsure if your existing hypothesis backlog is still valid, you should do another round. Start from scratch and when it is time to structure and prioritize (see below), just merge your new assumptions and hypotheses with your existing ones. 

4. Anytime
If you have not worked with explicit hypotheses yet, start now. See below for why, but there is no wrong time to begin. Requirements from 1. still apply, do those first.
