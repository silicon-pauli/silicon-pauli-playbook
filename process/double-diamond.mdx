# The Double Diamond

The Double Diamond process, was originally developed in 2005 as a simple graphical way of describing the design process
model based on the Design Council’s in­house research studying and analysing eleven leading companies. 
Dan Nessler enhanced it with parts of the Human Design Process and the Design Thinking Process when he was studying at Hyper Island.

We want to go from `Dont know` and `Could be` to `Do know` and `Should be`.

<figure>
    <img style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} src="/public/images/DD_02.svg" alt="The Double Diamond – Layer 1" />
    {/* <figcaption style={{ opacity: 0.5 }}><small><i>Fig. 2 – The Double Diamond – Layer 1</i></small></figcaption> */}
</figure>

We want to be `Designing the right thing` first and then `Designing things right`. This means we first find out what problems there are and then we find out the right ways to solve that problem.

<figure>
    <img style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} src="/public/images/DD_03.svg" alt="The Double Diamond – Layer 2" />
    {/* <figcaption style={{ opacity: 0.5 }}><small><i>Fig. 3 – The Double Diamond – Layer 2</i></small></figcaption> */}
</figure>

We do this by following four phases: 

1. **Discover** peoples problems. This is done with **research**.
2. **Define** the specific problem we want to solve. This is done by **synthesizing** the research results.
3. **Develop** potential solution to these problems. This is done with **ideation**.
4. **Deliver** feasible and viable solutions. This is done by iterative **implementation**.
  
You can easily just stop here and figure out what plays fits you and your team the best in each of the phases. Dan Nessler also provides are more methodological third layer, defining what plays to apply to reach the goals of each phase:

<figure>
    <img style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }} src="/public/images/DD_04.svg" alt="The Double Diamond – Layer 3" />
    {/* <figcaption style={{ opacity: 0.5 }}><small><i>Fig. 3 – The Double Diamond – Layer 2</i></small></figcaption> */}
</figure>

These sub-phases make use of the methods described in the next chapter.

TODO: Move initial DD plays into single plays:

##### Brief in: Rip it

Analyse the initial brief and question every part of it. We want to define potential fields of interest for the research phase.

##### Cluster topics

The topics extracted from the brief should be clustered and used as a basis for the following research. A good way to do this is by brainstorming any possibly interesting field of interest from the brief:

1. List out as many elements as you can (5 min.)
2. Pick each element and list it's characteristics (15 min.)
3. For each characteristic define extreme limits (15 min.)
4. In groups list as many places, people and experiences that exemplify each limit (15 min.)
