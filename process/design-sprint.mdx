# Design Sprint

The Design Sprint is a proven methodology for solving problems through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. 
Design Sprints quickly align teams under a shared vision with clearly defined goals and deliverables. 
Ultimately, it is a tool for developing a hypothesis, prototyping an idea, and testing it rapidly with as little investment as possible in as real an environment as possible.

The Design Sprint methodology was developed at Google from a vision to grow UX culture and the practice of design leadership across the organization. 
Multiple teams within Google experimented with different methods from traditional UX practice, IDEO, the Stanford dSchool, business strategy, and even psychology, applying them to support divergent and convergent thinking with teams. 
The resulting framework and set of methods is flexible, and teams are continuing to adapt it based on different goals and organizational cultures.

A Design Sprint usually is done within five days, but can be compressed into a single day if time is tight.
Typically it is structured like this:

##### Monday
Monday’s structured discussions create a path for the sprint week. 
In the morning, you’ll **start at the end** and agree to a long-term goal. 
Next, you’ll make a map of the challenge. In the afternoon, you’ll **ask the experts** at your company to share what they know. 
Finally, you’ll pick a **target**: an ambitious but manageable piece of the problem that you can solve in one week.

##### Tuesday
After a full day of understanding the problem and choosing a target for your sprint, on Tuesday, you get to focus on solutions. 
The day starts with inspiration: a review of existing ideas to **remix and improve**. 
Then, in the afternoon, each person will **sketch**, following a four-step process that emphasizes critical thinking over artistry. 
You’ll also begin planning Friday’s customer test by recruiting customers that fit your target profile.

##### Wednesday
By Wednesday morning, you and your team will have a stack of solutions. 
That’s great, but it’s also a problem. You can’t prototype and test them all—you need one solid plan. 
In the morning, you’ll critique each solution, and **decide** which ones have the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. 
Then, in the afternoon, you’ll take the winning scenes from your sketches and weave them into a **storyboard**: a step-by-step plan for your prototype.

##### Thursday
On Wednesday, you and your team created a storyboard. 
On Thursday, you’ll adopt a **“fake it”** philosophy to turn that storyboard into a **prototype**. 
A realistic façade is all you need to test with customers, and here’s the best part: 
by focusing on the customer-facing surface of your product or service, you can finish your prototype in just one day. 
On Thursday, you’ll also make sure everything is ready for Friday’s test by confirming the schedule, reviewing the prototype, and writing an interview script.

##### Friday
Your sprint began with a big challenge, an excellent team—and not much else. 
By Friday, you’ve created promising solutions, chosen the best, and built a realistic prototype. 
That alone would make for an impressively productive week. 
But you’ll take it one step further as you **interview** customers and **learn** by watching them react to your prototype. 
This test makes the entire sprint worthwhile: At the end of the day, you’ll know how far you have to go, and you’ll know just what to do next.
