# The Silicon Pauli Playbook

A playbook for creating successful digital products.  
Inspired by John Lax' [great article on Medium](https://medium.com/great-products-dont-happen-by-accident/great-products-dont-happen-by-accident-f46323d8ad94).

Great products don't magically appear out of nowhere. 
They are carefully crafted throughout an extensive product design process. 
Most of them are delightful and easy to use, beautiful to look at and provide outstanding value to their users.

> “Building a great product is an art as much as a science.” — Paul Adams

There are three main areas in which a great product excels:

* **Problem-Solution-Fit**: There is a real problem people have that is worth solving.
* **Product-Market-Fit**: There is a market for the solution. 
* **Distribution-Conversion-Fit**: The product can be scaled into mass-market.

In short a great product is economically viable, technologically feasible and emotional.

To ensure all three boxes are checked, we use a number of plays — many of those scientifically proven – along a non-linear process. These plays help us get a better (and shared) understanding of the users and the problems we are trying to solve, the market and the implementation of our product.

There is a wide range of processes to reach this goal.
We often employ a process called Double Diamond to ensure information is gathered in the right order while at the same time all allowing for iteration and pivoting.
