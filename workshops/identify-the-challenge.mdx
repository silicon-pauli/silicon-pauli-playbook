# Identify the challenge

Each workshop should be centered on a single, clearly defined challenge. 
This acts as a northstar throughout the workshop to keep the team focused on the problem they are trying to solve. 
Reviewing the challenge and goals with your teamâ€™s leadership early in the planning process ensures your workshop has the necessary support for the outcomes after the workshop.

Examples of good challenges (for a five day Design Sprint):

Redesign a user flow to increase conversion
Explore new models for discovering products in your e-commerce app
Improve the process for approving new projects
Define the vision for a new product offering
